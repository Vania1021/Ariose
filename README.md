  <section 1>
    Transations govern the circulation of ecomerce, products and service based in todays world. 
Based on how their consumer nature plays out, people are divided into segments, and with each purchase they make, their behaviour is compared to that of other people belonging to the same group with similar transaction history. Using Machine Learning algorithms, patterns can be established between the real and fraudulent transactions, on comparison of which, anomalies can be detected and the clients can be alerted.

    Fraud is not a Boolean concept, fraud is a probability, and that's what our Algorithm does, it predicts the fraud score to highest level of accuracy and based off of that we can predict if the transaction is a fraud or trustworthy.
